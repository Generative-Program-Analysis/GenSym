\section{Preliminaries}

In this section, we first describe the abstract syntax of the language we will
analyze, then present the generic interpreter shared among the four different
semantics, after which, we instantiate the interpreter to the concrete one. Then we
will proceed in two directions: by staging it we obtain a staged concrete interpreter
(Section~\ref{stagedinterp}); by abstracting it we obtain an unstaged abstract
interpreter (Section~\ref{unstaged_abs}).

We choose to use Scala and monad to demonstrate the idea, but the approach
is not restricted to our choice. One can use imperative style and other MSP languages 
(such as MetaOCaml \cite{DBLP:conf/gpce/CalcagnoTHL03, DBLP:conf/flops/Kiselyov14} 
or Template Haskell \cite{Sheard:2002:TMH:636517.636528} \todo{cite the recent one})
to construct such staged abstract interpreters.

\subsection{Abstract Syntax} \label{bg_lang}

We consider a call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus in direct-style, extended
with numbers, arithmetics, recursions and conditionals. Other effectful features
such as assignments can also be supported readily. In Section~\ref{cases_imp}, we
will add more imperative features to the language. Since we are mostly
interested in analyzing the dynamic behaviors of the program, we disguised any
static semantics and type system. We also assume that input programs are
well-typed and all variables are distinct. The abstract syntax is shown as
follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
  abstract class Expr
  case class Lit(i: Int) extends Expr                         // numbers
  case class Var(x: String) extends Expr                      // variables
  case class Lam(x: String, e: Expr) extends Expr             // abstractions
  case class App(e1: Expr, e2: Expr) extends Expr             // applications
  case class If0(e1: Expr, e2: Expr, e3: Expr) extends Expr   // conditionals
  case class Rec(x: String, rhs: Expr, e: Expr) extends Expr  // recursions
  case class Aop(op: String, e1: Expr, e2: Expr) extends Expr // arithmetics
\end{lstlisting}

The abstract syntax we present in fact can be seen as a deep embedding of the
language -- we use data-types to represent programs. This design choice makes us
easily add different interpretations over the AST; with the inheritance and
overriding mechanism in Scala, we may also add new language construct and reuse
the existing interpretation.

\iffalse
We will give the concrete semantics using a big-step definitional
interpreter. The interpreter is a recursive function that takes the program AST,
environment and store, and returns the evaluated value and the accompanied
store. The environment is a mapping from identifiers to addresses, and the store
is a mapping from addresses to values. We use the store to model recursion and
mutation in concrete semantics; it is also useful for polyvariant analysis. This
environment-and-store-passing style big-step interpreter is standard and can
also be obtained by refunctionalizing \cite{DBLP:conf/ppdp/AgerBDM03,
Wei:2018:RAA:3243631.3236800} a small-step CESK machine
\cite{DBLP:conf/popl/FelleisenF87}.

\subsection{Monads in Scala} \label{monadscala}

A monad is a type constructor @M[_]: * -> *@ with two operations, often called
@return@ and @bind@. Informally, @return@ wraps a value into the monad @M@, and
@bind@ unwraps the monadic value and transforms it to a new monadic value.
Pragmatically in Scala, we define a monad type class using trait @Monad@ (Figure
\ref{fig:monad}), where it declares the @pure@ \footnote{We elect to use
\texttt{pure} as the name, since \texttt{return} is a keyword in Scala and
\texttt{unit} is a built-in function in LMS.} and @flatMap@ operation. The trait
itself takes the monad type @M[_]@ as argument, which is a higher-kinded type
that takes a type and returns a type. The method @pure@ promotes values of type
@A@ to values of type @M[A]@. The monadic @bind@ operation is usually called
@flatMap@ in Scala, which takes a monad-encapsulated value of type @M[A]@, a
function of @A => M[B]@ and returns values of type @M[B]@.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.55\textwidth}
    \begin{lstlisting}
  trait Monad[M[_]] {                                  
    def pure[A](a: A): M[A]                            
    def flatMap[A,B](ma: M[A])(f: A => M[B]): M[B]     
  }                                                    
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{trait \texttt{Monad}} \label{fig:monad}
  \end{subfigure}
  ~
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
    \begin{lstlisting}
trait MonadOps[M[_], A] {
  def map[B](f: A => B): M[B]
  def flatMap[B](f: A => M[B]): M[B]
}
    \end{lstlisting}
    \caption{trait \texttt{MonadOps}} \label{fig:monadops}
  \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

Similar to Haskell's @do@-notation, Scala provides special syntactic support for
monadic operations through @for@-comprehension.
For example, an object of @List[A]@ is an instance of @List@ monad, where @A@ is the element type. 
Then to compute the the Cartesian product of two lists of numbers, we can use Scala's
@for@-comprehension syntax.

\begin{lstlisting}
  val xs = List(1, 2); val ys = List(4, 5)
  for { x <- xs; y <- ys } yield (x, y) // List((1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5))
\end{lstlisting}

The Scala compiler will translate the above @for@-comprehension expression into
an equivalent one using @flatMap@ and @map@ ~\cite{scala_spec}. The last binding
in the @for@-comprehension is translated into a @map@, where the expression of
@yield@ becomes the body expression of that @map@ application. The foregoing
bindings in the comprehension are all translated into calls of @flatMap@.

\begin{lstlisting}
  xs.flatMap { case x => ys.map { case y => (x, y) } }
\end{lstlisting}

Note that here the monadic object @List[_]@ encapsulates the data internally.
Therefore it only exposes the simplified version of @flatMap@, where the
monad @M[A]@ is not introduced as a function argument. The trait @MonadOps@
(Figure \ref{fig:monadops}) defines the simplified version of monadic
operations that are necessary for @for@-comprehension. 
The conversion between @Monad@ and @MonadOps@ can be done by using implicit design pattern.
In the rest of the paper, we use Scala's @for@-comprehension syntax and monad
transformers such as @ReaderT@, @StateT@, and @ListT@ to write our interpreters.
The implementation of monads and monad transformers essentially borrows the
ground-truth from Haskell.

\subsection{Generic Interpreter} \label{generic_if}

Monad transformers are type constructors of kind @(* -> *) -> (* -> *)@, which
takes a monad as argument and produces another monad. By using monad
transformers, we can combine multiple monads into a single one. Constructing
extensible interpreters using monad transformers was first proposed by
\citet{DBLP:conf/popl/LiangHJ95}, and later has been applied to abstract
interpreters \cite{Sergey:2013:MAI:2491956.2491979,
DBLP:journals/pacmpl/DaraisLNH17, Darais:2015:GTM:2814270.2814308}. In section,
with the multi-stage programming and monad transformers in mind while leave them
as abstract type members, we present the generic interface of a big-step
definitional interpreter.

\paragraph{Basic type definitions} We start with some basic type definitions.
The identifiers in the program are represented by strings. The two default
components in the interpreter are environments @Env@ and stores @Store@, i.e.,
mappings from identifiers to addresses and mappings from addresses to values,
respectively. But the @Addr@ and @Value@ are just declared as abstract types.

\begin{lstlisting}
  trait Semantics {
    type Ident = String; type Addr; type Value
    type Env = Map[Ident, Addr]; type Store = Map[Addr, Value]
    type R[_] // Binding-time as a higher-kinded type
    ... // The definitions in the rest of this section are enclosed in trait Semantics.
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Binding-time abstraction} As mentioned before, the binding-time is
declared as a higher-kinded type @R[_]@. If we instantiate @R@ as an identity
type (i.e., @type R[T] = T@), then the generic interpreter will execute the program.
In Section \ref{stagedinterp}, we will instantiate @R@ using LMS's built-in
next-stage type annotation @Rep@, which makes the interpreter act as a compiler.

\paragraph{Monadic operations} We define the return type of the interpreter as
@Ans@, which is an arbitrary monad type @AnsM[_]@ wrapping the type @Value@. 
As mentioned in Section ~\ref{monadscala}, to use the @for@-comprehension
syntax, certain constraints have to be posed onto the type @AnsM@. Here, we use a
structural type @MonadOps@ to require @AnsM@ to at least implement @map@ and
@flatMap@. It is worth noting that @MonadOps@ takes another type parameter
@R[_]@ as binding-time; accordingly the outer @R@ defined in the trait is passed
to @MonadOps@. Inside of @MonadOps@, @R[_]@ wraps the data types @A@ and @B@ that are
encapsulated by the monad, but not the monad type @M@ itself. When acting as
compilers, we will also replace the monads to the ones that work on staged
values.

We also defines several methods to obtain and modify the environment and store.
These methods either returns monadic values with environment or store inside, or
simply a @Unit@ value for effects. For example, @ext_env@ takes a value @ans@ of
type @Ans@ and a pair of binding that maps @x@ to $\alpha$, and installs this
binding to the environment when evaluating @ans@.

\vspace{-1em}
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \begin{lstlisting}
  type MonadOps[R[_], M[_], A] = {
    def map[B](f: R[A] => R[B]): M[B]
    def flatMap[B](f: R[A] => M[B]): M[B]
  }
  
  type AnsM[T] <: MonadOps[R, AnsM, T]
  type Ans = AnsM[Value]
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{subfigure}
  ~
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.55\textwidth}
    \begin{lstlisting}
// Environment operations
def ask_env: AnsM[Env]
def ext_env(ans: Ans)(xÎ±: (Ident, R[Addr])): Ans
// Store operations
def get_store: AnsM[Store]
def put_store(Ï: R[Store]): AnsM[Unit]
def set_store(av: (R[Addr], R[Value])): AnsM[Unit]
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-1em}

\paragraph{Primitive operations} Next we define several primitive operations.
Two versions of @alloc@ are declared. The first one takes a store and an
identifier, and produces a fresh address of non-monadic type @R[Addr]@. Since
the freshness of the address may depend on the store, which might be a
next-stage value as indicated by its type, the type of addresses is also wrapped
by @R[_]@. The other one would simply wrap the address with our monadic type
@AnsM[_]@.
\begin{lstlisting}
  def alloc(Ï: R[Store], x: Ident): R[Addr];  def alloc(x: Ident): AnsM[Addr]
\end{lstlisting}

Other primitive operations provide basic functionality for the interpreter.
The method @num@ and @close@ deal with primitive values, which lift literal
terms (e.g., lambdas) to our value representation (e.g., closures).
The method @get@ simply retrieves the value mapped from the identifier @x@ in
the environment and store. Conditionals and arithmetics is handled by @br0@
and @arith@, respectively. The methods @ap_clo@ takes a function value and an
argument value and then does the application.

%TODO: close/ap_clo takes an ev

\begin{lstlisting}
  def num(i: Int): Ans
  def get(Ï: R[Store], Ï: R[Env], x: Ident): R[Value]
  def close(ev: Expr => Ans)(Î»: Lam, Ï: R[Env]): R[Value]
  def br0(test: R[Value], thn: => Ans, els: => Ans): Ans
  def arith(op: Symbol, v1: R[Value], v2: R[Value]): R[Value]
  def ap_clo(ev: Expr => Ans)(fun: R[Value], arg: R[Value]): Ans
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{The interpreter} Now we can define the semantics-agnostic interpreter
in monadic form. The essential idea is to traverse the abstract syntax tree
while maintaining the effects such as reader and state. 
It is worth noting that the interpreter is written in open-recursive style -- it
can not refer to itself directly, instead, @eval@ takes an additional parameter
@ev@ of type @Expr => Ans@ to refer to itself. Accordingly, the method @close@
that lifts lambda terms to closures and @ap_clo@ that applies functions also
takes an extra @ev@.

\begin{lstlisting}
  def eval(ev: Expr => Ans)(e: Expr): Ans = e match {
    case Lit(i) => num(i)                      case Let(x, rhs, e) => for {
    case Var(x) => for {                         v <- ev(rhs)
      Ï <- ask_env                               Î± <- alloc(x)
      Ï <- get_store                             _ <- set_store(Î± â v)
     } yield get(Ï, Ï, x)                        rt <- ext_env(ev(e))(x â Î±)
    case Lam(x, e) => for {                    } yield rt
      Ï <- ask_env                             case Aop(op, e1, e2) => for {
    } yield close(ev)(Lam(x, e), Ï)              v1 <- ev(e1)                                               
    case App(e1, e2) => for {                    v2 <- ev(e2)
      v1 <- ev(e1)                             } yield arith(op, v1, v2)
      v2 <- ev(e2)                             case Rec(x, rhs, e) => for {
      rt <- ap_clo(ev)(v1, v2)                   Î± <- alloc(x)
    } yield rt                                   v <- ext_env(ev(rhs))(x â Î±)
    case If0(e1, e2, e3) => for {                _ <- set_store(Î± â v)
      cnd <- ev(e1)                              rt <- ext_env(ev(e))(x â Î±)
      rt <- br0(cnd, ev(e2), ev(e3))           } yield rt                    
    } yield rt
  }
\end{lstlisting}

Since the interpreter is written in open-recursive style, we declare an abstract
combinator @fix@ used to close the recursion. For concrete-interpretation instantiation, it
works like the Y combinator; for abstract-interpretation instantiation, we will
instrument the interpreter by defining a memorized version of @fix@ to ensure
termination. Finally, a top-level wrapper @run@ is declared; the return type
@Result@ depends on what kind of monad we will be using, thus is also an abstract type.

\begin{lstlisting}
  def fix(ev: (Expr => Ans) => (Expr => Ans)): Expr => Ans
  type Result; def run(e: Expr): Result
\end{lstlisting}

%==========================================================================

\subsection{A Concrete Interpreter} \label{unstaged_conc}

Now we can instantiate a concrete interpreter. We first concretize the abstract
types as follows. Since the interpreter is concrete, for the purpose that
properly models the heap, the type \texttt{Int} is used for address space
\texttt{Addr}. The environment and store are just ordinary \texttt{Map}s in
Scala. A value can be either a tagged number \texttt{NumV} or a closure
\texttt{CloV} that contains a lambda term and an environment.

\begin{lstlisting}
trait Concrete extends Semantics {
  type Addr = Int;   sealed trait Value
  case class CloV($\lambda$: Lam, $\rho$: Env) extends Value
  case class NumV(i: Int) extends Value
  type Env = Map[Ident, Addr];  type Store = Map[Addr, Value]
}
\end{lstlisting}

We proceed to implement the components that define the semantics. As mentioned
before, type \texttt{R} is concretized as an identity type function, thus all
types are just ordinary types.

\begin{lstlisting}
object ConcInterp extends Concrete {
  type R[+T] = T
  val $\rho$0 = Map[Ident,Addr]();  val $\sigma$0 = Map[Addr,Value]()
  def get($\rho$: Env, x: Ident): Addr = $\rho$(x)
  def put($\rho$: Env, x: Ident, a: Addr): Env = $\rho$ + (x -> a)
  def get($\sigma$: Store, a: Addr): Value = $\sigma$(a)
  def put($\sigma$: Store, a: Addr, v: Value): Store = $\sigma$ + (a -> v)
  def alloc($\sigma$: Store, x: Ident): Addr = $\sigma$.size + 1
  def close(ev: EvalFun)($\lambda$: Lam, $\rho$: Env): Value = CloV($\lambda$, $\rho$)
  def num(i: Lit): Value = NumV(i.i)
  def apply_closure(ev: EvalFun)
    (f: Value, arg: Value, $\sigma$: Store): Ans = f match {
      case CloV(Lam(x, e), $\rho$) =>
        val $\alpha$ = alloc($\sigma$, x); val $\rho$_* = put($\rho$, x, $\alpha$)
        val $\sigma$_* = put($\sigma$, $\alpha$, arg); ev(e, $\rho$_*, $\sigma$_*)
    }
  def branch0(cnd: Value, thn: => Ans, els: => Ans): Ans = 
    cnd match { case NumV(i) => if (i == 0) thn else els }
  def prim_eval(op: Symbol, v1: Value, v2: Value): Value = 
    op match {
      case '+ => v1.asInstanceOf[NumV].i + v2.asInstanceOf[NumV].i
      ...
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, \texttt{get} and \texttt{put} directly manipulate the map of
environment and store. An allocation function is used when we need to update the
store: in the concrete case, \texttt{alloc} always returns a fresh address of
the store. \texttt{close} and \texttt{num} lift syntactic literals to values.
\texttt{apply\_closure} takes the function value, argument value and the latest
store, then extends the environment and store after allocating a fresh address,
and continue evaluating the body \texttt{e} of the lambda term.
