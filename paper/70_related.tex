\textbf{Abstract Compilation}. The idea in this paper is closely inspired by 
abstract compilation \cite{Boucher:1996:ACN:647473.727587}.
\citeauthor{Boucher:1996:ACN:647473.727587} presented abstract compilation
techniques as an efficient implementation of the monovariant flow analysis 
\textit{0}-CFA for programs in continuation-passing style. The key idea is to 
reduce the interpretation overhead on traversing the syntax tree by partial evaluation.
Specifically, they proposed two kinds of abstract compilers to achieve this. 
The first one is to generate specialized analysis as a textual program, then 
can be loaded and executed by \texttt{eval} or similar mechanisms. The second 
one is using closure as a representation of specialized analysis. 
A closure is a function that remembers the environment where it defined. So the 
abstract compiler generates higer-order functions on-the-fly rather than textual 
program, then the functions can be applied immediately in a higher-order host language.

\citeauthor{Johnson:2013:OAA:2500365.2500604} in their work also adopt the 
idea closure generation for optimizing small-step abstracting abstract machine
\cite{Johnson:2013:OAA:2500365.2500604}. The source program is firstly compiled
to intermediate form called "abstract bytecode", which are actually higher-order functions, 
and then executed on a abstract abstract machine.

control flow analysis \cite{amtoft1999partial}.

\citeauthor{hardekopf2011flow} apply staging to flow-sensitive pointer analysis \cite{hardekopf2011flow}. 
They firstly stage the program code to obtain a sparse representation, then conduct
the flow-sensitive analysis.
