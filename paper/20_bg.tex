concrete interpreter.

\subsection{From Interpreter to Abstract Interpreter}

big-step abstract interpreter using delimited control operators \cite{Wei:2018:RAA:3243631.3236800}.

monadic big-step abstract interpreter \cite{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/DaraisLNH17}.

\subsection{Multi-Stage Programming}

general idea; LMS framework in scala. MetaOCaml?

Other notable implementations of MSP exist in ML family, for examples, MetaML \cite{DBLP:conf/pepm/TahaS97} 
and MetaOCaml \cite{DBLP:conf/gpce/CalcagnoTHL03, DBLP:conf/flops/Kiselyov14}.
Compared with the LMS approach in Scala, MetaML/MetaOCaml use term-level annotations such as brackets, 
escape, and run. Notwithstanding, we use LMS in this paper, the idea of staging an abstract interpreter
still applies with other MSP implementations.
