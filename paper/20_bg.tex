\section{Background}

In this section, we first described the language we will model and analyze, and present an unstaged concrete 
interpreter for it. Then, starting from this unstaged concrete interpreter, we proceed in two directions:
by abstracting it we obtain an unstaged abstract interpreter; by staging it we obtain a staged concrete
interpreter.
