\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we first present the implementaion of first Futamura projection
on abstract interpreters. To realize it, we design a generic interpreter that
abstracts over both binding-time and value domains; by instantiating it
differently, the staged abstract interpreter can be readily derived. We also
conduct case studies and empirical evaluation, demonstrating a wide
applicability of our approach and evaluating the performance improved by staging.
