It is well known that a staged interpreter is a compiler, which provides performance improvement
by eliminate the overhead of traversing the abstract syntax tree.

In this paper, we study staged \textit{abstract} interpreters.

We show staged abstract interpreters have practical applications rather than just theoretical merit.
The time consumed of a analysis can be decreased by staging (TODO: to what degree). We evaluate
the improvement of performance on benchmark programs.
Another application of staged abstract interpreter is to transform whole-program analysis
to modular analysis without losing precison. The generated code can be viewed as a 
partially analyzed result, which also can be composed and used latter with other modulars
in the program.
