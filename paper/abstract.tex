It is well known that a staged interpreter is a compiler, which provides performance improvement
by specializing the interpreter to a given program.

In this paper, we study \textit{abstract} interpreters with multi-stage programming, i.e., the 
staged abstract interpreters. 
By staging an abstract interpreter respect to a program, we obtain a compiled and faster analysis.
By appying the idea to \textit{open} programs, we obtain a modular analysis that generates sound
partial analysis results which can be composed and reused later without losing precision, though 
the original abstract interpreter is a whole-program analysis algorithm.

We show several case studies using the idea of staged abstract interpreters, including 
\citeauthor{Boucher:1996:ACN:647473.727587}'s abstract compilation of Shiver's 0-CFA, pushdown
control-flow analysis with context/path/flow-sensitivity and store-widening, and a numerical
analysis on a imperative language.

We also evaluate the improvement of performance on benchmark programs for a subset of Scheme.
