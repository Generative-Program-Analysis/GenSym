The paper also describes a method to automatically generate an actual compiler from a formal description which is, in some sense, the partial evaluation of a computation process. The compiler-compiler inspired by this method differs from conventional ones in that the compiler-compiler based on our method can describe an evaluation procedure (interpreter) in defining the semantics of a programming language, while the conventional one describes a translation process.",

  title = "Abstract Interpretation as a Programming Language",
  abstract = "In David Schmidts PhD work he explored the use of denotational semantics as a programming language. It was part of an effort to not only treat formal semantics as specifications but also as interpreters and input to compiler generators. The semantics itself can be seen as a program and one mayexamine different programming styles and ways to representstates. Abstract interpretation is primarily a technique for derivation and specification of program analysis. As with denotational semantics we may also view abstract interpretations as programs and examine the implementation. The main focus in this paper is to show that results from higher-order strictness analysis may be used more generally as fixpoint operators for higher-order functions over lattices and thus provide a technique for immediate implementation of a large class of abstract interpretations. Furthermore, it may be seen as a programming paradigm and be used to write programsin a circular style.",

    This chapter discusses the basis for a mathematical theory of computation. It describes several descriptive formalisms with a few examples of their use, and illustrates the theory that enables to prove the equivalence of computations expressed in these formalisms. Some of the formalisms treated are computable functional, non-computable functions, and ambiguous functions. The chapter presents a few mathematical results about the properties of the formalisms introduced. A number of new formalisms for expressing computable functions and related entities are described. The relation between formalism and computer programming languages is discussed."

  abstract="With Gaussian Elimination as a representative family of numerical and symbolic algorithms, we use multi-stage programming, monads and Ocaml's advanced module system to demonstrate the complete elimination of the abstraction overhead while avoiding any inspection of the generated code. We parameterize our Gaussian Elimination code to a great extent (over domain, matrix representations, determinant tracking, pivoting policies, result types, etc) at no run-time cost. Because the resulting code is generated just right and not changed afterwards, we enjoy MetaOCaml's guaranty that the generated code is well-typed. We further demonstrate that various abstraction parameters (aspects) can be made orthogonal and compositional, even in the presence of name-generation for temporaries and other bindings and ``interleaving'' of aspects. We also show how to encode some domain-specific knowledge so that ``clearly wrong'' compositions can be statically rejected by the compiler when processing the generator rather than the generated code.",
