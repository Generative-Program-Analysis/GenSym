\section{Related Work}

Along with dynamic taint analysis, forward symbolic execution is widely used in
software security and bug finding. \citet{DBLP:conf/sp/SchwartzAB10} discussed
those techniques in a security context. Using a simple low-level intermediate
language, they presented a formalization of forward symbolic execution in the form of
small-step operational semantics. Existing challenges of symbolic execution and
potential mitigations are also discussed.
